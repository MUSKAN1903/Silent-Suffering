# [Suicides in India : An In-depth Data Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muskan.singh6054/viz/Silent_Suffering/FINALREPORT)
> - In this data-driven journey, we leverage the power of Tableau to analyze and visualize the complexities of suicides in India.
> - Our interactive Tableau dashboards present a dynamic and comprehensive exploration of the data, offering deep insights into the patterns, trends, and underlying factors contributing to this critical societal concern.
> - Tableau's interactive features empower users to dive deep into the data, enabling us to  gain valuable insights into the distribution of suicide cases across regions, age groups, and genders, shedding light on critical patterns and underlying factors.
> - The project aims to raise awareness, promote evidence-based discussions, and foster informed decision-making for a collective effort towards suicide prevention and mental health support in India.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
> The aim is to make an analysis of suicide rates and different reasons due to which people have committed suicide in India. It is very important to understand the reason to commit suicide and Data Science helps in this regard.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
> -	There is good reason to examine Indian suicide data, partly because of the importance of what the findings might mean when compared to data from other countries and cultures. What do the findings show in relation to the causation of suicide, and thus to preventative strategies.
> -	Ongoing attention to such data (including differences in rates and patterns between genders, across the age-range, between sub-populations and over time) may be of key importance in understanding suicidal intentions and planning interventions aimed at averting suicide.

### BACKGROUND STUDY
> -	India is a vast country with a population of 1.38 billion.
> -	In Total, this population is equivalent to nearly 17.7% of total people alive today.
> -	According to the Indian government, Suicides are an important cause of death in India.
> -	India accounts for approximately 17% of worldwide suicides.
> -	The estimation of the number of suicides in India varies from source to source because of such a high volume of population. 
> -	India is an ever-growing country and the quality of information about suicide in India is quite limited, but it is an important and growing public health concern.
> -	Compared to suicides in high-income developed countries, suicides in India are more prevalent and complicated to understand & analyze.

### DATA SOURCE & DATA EXTRACTION
> - This data set was collected from Kaggle website, where it was published by Rajanand Ilangovan. 
> - The dataset is featured and verified by Kaggle.
> https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/suicides-in-india

### CONTENT
> - Time Period: 2001 - 2012
> - Granularity: Yearly
> - Location: States and U.T's of India

### Parameters:
> a) Suicide causes
> b) Education status
> c) By means adopted
> d) Professional profile
> e) Social status

### TECHNOLOGY USED

> -	We used tableau software (tableau desktop) to extract useful information and effectively present our findings it in form of graphs and other techniques. 
> -	Concepts used: hierarchy, groups, filters, graphs, story, dashboards, ranks, index, quick table calculations, dual axis, calculated fields
> -	Visualizations: bar graph, stacked bars, donut chart, butterfly chart, lollipop chart, tree map, crosstab heatmap, motion line, bump chart, maps, interactive dashboard, story presentation.

### EXPLORING OUR DATA
> -	Suicide is the ultimate outcome of a complicated correlation of genetic, biological, physiological, sociological, and environmental factors. 
> -	The number of suicides in the whole world is estimated at nearly 9000000 people, from which 170,000 are from India. 
> -	This accounts for nearly 18% of suicide worldwide. There is a valuable reason to understand and study Indian suicide data. 
> -	It is because of what outcomes and results we get as compared to data from other countries. 
> -	These findings display the relationship for the causation of suicide and thus helps to find prevention strategies.
> -	Properly examining such data which includes differences in rates& patterns in gender, age group, population over some time may provide the key to understanding the suicidal purpose and therefore plan intervention aimed towards forestalling suicide.

### RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
> -	In this analysis, we used secondary data from the worldâ€™s largest data science community Kaggle. In which we took the data set of suicides happening in India in the past decade from 2001 to 2012. 
> -	Analysis is performed by considering various parameters like States-wise suicides, considering the factor of Age and gender in increasing and decreasing the number of suicides in India.
> -	Further, we designed visual representations to properly understand, compare useful insights and trends. In the end, we complied and integrate all of these data representations, comparisons, and trends to gain the desired output.
